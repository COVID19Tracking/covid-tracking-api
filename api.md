The default response is JSON using normal GET requests. If you'd like CSV just use `.csv` as an extension instead of `.json` at the end of the url.

All data is cumulative (unless specifically noted), so you should not see any counts going down over time. If you do, please get in touch as it is likely an error. As you might be able to tell from the key names, date time values are in ET.

Please be aware that each state has its own set of caveats, which we have documented on our [data page](/data/).

Major API revisions will be versioned. Please see fields marked _DEPRECATED_ below.

If you want to filter the `/api/states/daily` you can add a query param like `?state=NY` to only show cases in New York. Or `/api/states/daily?state=NY&date=20200316` to show the result of a specific date. Or to access the most recent value `/api/states?state=NY`.
