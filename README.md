# ðŸ‘· Covid Tracking API

A [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that makes a requests to get the sheet info and then cleans it up a bit and returns an array of values.

## Initial Basic API - JSON Endpoints

* States current - https://covid.cape.io/states
* States daily 4 pm ET - https://covid.cape.io/states/daily
* States info - https://covid.cape.io/states/info
* US current - https://covid.cape.io/us
* US daily - https://covid.cape.io/us/daily
* Counties- https://covid.cape.io/counties

## How

Currently each and every request to an endpoint makes an API request to google and cleans it up before returning results. A cache can be configured if desired.
